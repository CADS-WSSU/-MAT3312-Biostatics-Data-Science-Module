# MAT3312-Biostatics-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's Center for Applied Data Science (CADS) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions. 
# Biostatistics
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of a course in Biostatistics as taught by Dr. Felicia Simpson. The Biostatistics course is offered in the Mathematics department once a year at Winston-Salem State University. Majority of students who enroll in this course are those majoring in mathematics (concentrating in statistics), public health and biology. However, this course is primarily intended for all students whose interests and/or professional goals involve data analysis. 

The topics in this course include: data collection, descriptive statistics, statistical inference, probability, hypothesis testing, categorical data analysis, regression/correlation methods, and design and analysis techniques for epidemiologic studies.

# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this reposity concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. These modules are classified into four broad areas:
